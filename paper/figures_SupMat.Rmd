```{r addingTaxa, fig.cap = "Correlation between original dark diversity and dark diversity results after randomly adding a percentage of highly suitable taxa to observed diversity (2%,5%,10%,15%,20%,25%). Even after adding 25% of highly suitable taxa to observed diversity, the correlation between the original dark diveristy size and the one after imputation is still high (95%), suggesting that sampling bias issue is minimal in our dark diversity results. The identity line is drawn on each graph."}

```{r removingSites, fig.cap = "Correlation between original dark diversity and dark diversity results after removing closest sites (1-6 sites). The correlation between the original dark diveristy size and the dark diversity size after removing six closest sites is still high (98%), suggesting that autocorrelation issue is minimal in our dark diversity results. The identity line is drawn on each graph."}

```{r ObsDDFreq, fig.cap="Relative frequency of taxa in observed and dark diversity from 14500 years before present (cal. yr BP) until the present. The relative frequency of taxa was calculated for each 500-year time window using the number of times taxa occupied a site (observed diversity) or were suitable but absent (dark diversity) divided by the number of sites at each time window. Only taxa with more than 30% of frequency either within observed or dark diversity in any time window are shown."}

```{r PCA, fig.cap = "Principal component analysis of the functional spectra of plants in Northern Europe, depicting the first axis represented by Height (hmax), seed weight (sm) and clonality and the second axis represented by specific leaf area (sla) and pollination. The first axis (PC1) explains 45.1% of the total variation and the second axis (PC2) explains 19.3% of the total variation."}

Number of taxa in both observed and dark diversity, as well species pool size of sites in NE Europe over the past 14500 years (cal. yr BP). Lines represent the fits of GAM and shaded areas the 95% confidence intervals."}
